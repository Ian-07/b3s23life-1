Special-purpose utility scripts, search data, pattern files, etc. related to Conway's Game of Life

This repository is intended to be a more accessible storage location for Life-related scripts, results of custom searches, and large collections of patterns of various kinds that may not have a home elsewhere.

Many or most of these files are already available on one thread or another at http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/.  The main advantage of the repository format is that it allows for better organization of all this material.

On November 20, 2020 this repository was simplified to remove several large unwieldy little-used files, and/or the space-consuming git history of those files.  If you want anything that can no longer be found here, please let me know at b3s23life [at] gmail.com.
